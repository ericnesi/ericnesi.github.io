title: Spatial Analysis of Australia's NBL 2016-2017 Season
---

I have been obsessesed with basketball my entire life, and knew this topic was going to be the focus of my capstone project for the General Assembly Data Science Immersive course in Sydney.  I drew inspiration for this project from people who have done a spatial analysis of basketball in the past, specifically Kirk Goldsberry's and his writing for the now-defunct Grantland.  My goal at the beginning of the project was to use the skills that I was learning in the course, and analyze the 2016/2017 defensive performance of the Sydney Kings based on the areas of the court from where the Kings allowed teams to shoot.  After doing a bit of research, I had an email discussion with Andrew Price of SpatialJam.com, who was able to point me in the right direction to begin doing this type of analysis.  Despite intially focusing on only the Sydney Kings, I quickly realized the project needed to expand and look at the efficiency of every NBL team throughout the 2016/2017 season. 

In order to start this project, I first needed to acquire some data.  Given the fact, I was attempting to scrape months after the the games occured, I knew that I may not be able to get all the data I wanted.  In the end, I was able to acquire the shot data from every game except for two during the 2016-2017 season.  After locating the API, I was able to from FibaLiveStats.com.  After,  I was able to write a funciton to scrape the data I needed using its the Requests library and JSON library in Python.
