title: DSI Capstone Project - Part 1
---

The inspiration for this project, began with.  I was able to chat to Andrew Price of SpatialJam.com, who was able to point me in the right direction to begin doing this type of spatial analysis.  Essentially, I wanted to analyze 2016/2017 defensive performance of the Sydney Kings in Australia's NBL by collecting data based on the areas of the court from where the Kings allowed teams to shoot.  This quickly expanded into a look at efficiency on particular areas of the court for ecery team throughout the 2016/2017 season.  In order to start this project, I first needed to acquire some data.  

I was able to write a function to scrape data for every game throughout the 2016-2017 season, except for two games.  Given the fact, I was attempting to scrape this data months after the cat, I undrstood that to collect data.
