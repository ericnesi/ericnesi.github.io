title: DSI Capstone Project - Part 1
---

The inspiration for this project was the shot spatial data, specifically Kirk Goldsberry and his writing for Grantland.  Essentially, I wanted to see if I could use my skills that I was learning the General Assembly Data Science Immersive course, and recreate hex-binned shot charts for Australia's NBL.  After doing a bit of research, I was able to chat with Andrew Price of SpatialJam.com, who was able to point me in the right direction to begin doing this type of spatial analysis.  Essentially, I wanted to analyze 2016/2017 defensive performance of the Sydney Kings in Australia's NBL by collecting data based on the areas of the court from where the Kings allowed teams to shoot.  This quickly expanded into a look at efficiency on particular areas of the court for every NBL team throughout the 2016/2017 season.  

In order to start this project, I first needed to acquire some data.  Given the fact, I was attempting to scrape this data months after the the games occured, I knew that I may not be able to get all the data I wanted.   That said, I felt I was able to acquire enough to draw some conclusions. After locating the API on from FibaLiveStats.com, I was able to write a funciton to scrape the data I needed using its the Requests library and JSON library in Python.
