title: Spatial Analysis of Australia's NBL 2016-2017 Season
---

I have been obsessesed with basketball my entire life, and knew that the focus of my capstone project for the General Assembly Data Science Immersive course in Sydney would be related to basketball.  I drew inspiration for this project from people who have done a spatial analysis of basketball in the past, specifically Kirk Goldsberry's and his writing for the now-defunct Grantland.  My goal was to use the skills that I was learning in the course to analyze the 2016/2017 defensive performance of the Sydney Kings based on the areas of the court from where the Kings allowed teams to shoot.  After doing a bit of research, I had an email discussion with Andrew Price of [SpatialJam.com][SpatialJam], who was able to point me in the right direction to begin doing this type of analysis. Despite intially focusing on only the Sydney Kings, I quickly realized the project needed to expand and look at the location-based shot efficiency of the entire league over the course of the 2016/2017 season.

#### Scraping, Cleaning, & Modeling:

In order to start this project, I first needed to acquire some data.  I acquired the shot data from [Fiba Live Stats][Fibalive] Given the fact, I was attempting to scrape data months after the the games occured, I knew that I may not be able to get all the data I wanted.  In the end, I was able to acquire the shot data from every game except for two during the 2016-2017 NBL season.  After locating the API for one of the games, I was able to compile a list for every game in using Python.  Then, I wrote a function to scrape the data I needed using the Requests library and JSON library in Python.  

Follow this **[link][Scrape]** to observe my Python Notebook for the scraping.

While cleaning and performing an exploratory data analysis on the data, I encountered a few crucial issues which I needed to resolve.  Here are just a couple:

***Problem: Calculating distance from the hoop.***

***Solution:***  My data as extracted was on plotted on a full basketball court.  As such, I needed to flip half of my data so that all of the data was on the same side of the court and the locations of the shots were correct.  Next, I examined the **[FIBA][FIBA_Rules]** rulebook for court images and measurements.  I extracted a court image from the rulebook, fit it under my data, and marked down the coordinates of the hoop.  Given that a regulation FIBA court is 28m long by 15m wide, this meant I needed to account for these measurements when I used the distance formula.

***Problem: Gridding my court to bin shot data by specific court location.***  

***Solution:*** These would eventually be my dummy variables in my regression model, and are extremely powerful in my interactive Tableau Vizualisations.  Originally when I calculated distance using the distance formula, I did not account for the measurements of the court, so my distance was off.  As such, I could not figure out a way to break the court down into logical areas. Once I had my distance, my problem was solved as I could use a combination of distance measurements provided in the FIBA Rulebook and X,Y coordinates to grid properly.

In my model, I set the shot result as the target. Essentially, I was trying to train/test a model that could predict when a shot would be made based on floor location.  Given my entire project was geared towards this spatial analysis, I tried to make sure distance and my floor locations were predictors in this analysis.  

I used both logistic regression model, and a Random Forest model in an attempt to predict this binary target.  However, my accuracy for both the NBL Data and the Kings Defensive Data was not great.  Despite attmepts through gridsearching to hone my model, I feel it lacked sufficient accuracy and in reality lacked significant purpose. In other words, as I reflected on my model, I realized the conceit of the model is not.  With this project, 

That said, working through the modeling process did reveal a few things to me.  These coefficients reveal that other than Restricted Area, there are not any strong positive predictors for a successful shot result in my data.  That said, from my visualizations I know that there are other ways of presenting shot efficiency.

#### Results and Visualization:

The crown jewels of my project are my Tableau workbooks, which allowed me to visualize my data on a basketball court. Using the powerful functionality of Tableau, I was able to clearly visualize the most efficient shots based on location on the court. Furthermore, I knew I wanted my visualizations to be interactive.  As such, I made sure that every filter is dynamic, meaning that you can select a team, opponent, court location, quarter, or distance, and the Effective Field Goal% is changed with it.

When it comes to hexbinning, I spent a long time trying to create a grid of maleable hexagons over the court, looking at things like GIS, MMQIS, and ARCGIS. However, I was really struggling. Luckily, I stumbled upon an [article][hexbin_article] about Tableau's hexbinning functionality that worked extremely well for me.  It allowed me to hexbin the court size each bin according to frequency of shots and color each bin according to relation to league EFG% average, a number I had calculated just because I thought it may be useful going forward.  I took the overall player totals from every player in the league and just copy and saved them as a csv.  I then was able to quickly group by team and calculate the EFG% average for every team and for the entire league.

I did not feel I had enough data per point to draw conclusions from hexbinning my Kings data. That said, my hexbin plot for all shots reveal an interesting trend I noticed in my data.

I built these visual tools to eventually analyze the data that I acquired. The EFG% marker is set to a 50.81%, which is the league average for the season.  This means that shots from these red areas were the most effective during the 2016/2017 season.  Furthermore, the data size of each bin is adjusted based on frequency.  Unsurprisingly, the most effective shots came within the restricted area.  However, shots from inside the paint, but out of the restricted area were fairly innefficient league-wide.  This mirrored my results for shots taken against the Sydney Kings as well.  What this means is that shots which are close, but not right at the hoop, were actually innefficient over the entire season. This stands in direct contradiction to the fact that these shots made up the largest percentage of shots taken. A breakdown of this data confirms this:
